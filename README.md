# Project Writeup

  1. What were some challenges you faced while making this app?
     - This is my first time creating an application that spans from the frontend to the backend, including the database. 
      For me, every part of the project is new and poses a significant challenge. There are many new concepts and technologies that I need to learn. 
      One of the most challenging aspects that has left a lasting impression on me is managing password security. 
      Ensuring that passwords are securely shared and stored requires understanding complex security protocols and implementing robust encryption methods. 
      Each step of this project is a learning opportunity, pushing me to expand my skills and understanding of application development.
  
  2. Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make
     - I will try to add an auto-fill feature for passwords on stored websites, enhancing user convenience and efficiency.
       Furthermore, I plan to improve the user interface design to make it more intuitive and engaging.
       This would involve simplifying navigation and adding visually appealing elements that enhance the overall user experience.

  3. What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?
     - When working on this project, we started with a set of assumptions that significantly shaped our development process.
       We assumed that not every user is very familiar with technology, so we needed to make the functionality easy and straightforward.
       We also assumed that security is one of the most important considerations for users of our app, which deeply influenced our app design.
       Additionally, we gained insights into the practical challenges of implementing security measures, balancing user convenience with stringent security protocols.
       This project not only honed our technical skills but also deepened our understanding of user-centered design and the importance of flexibility in software development.

  4. How long did this assignment take to complete?
     - This project takes us 10 days to finish.
